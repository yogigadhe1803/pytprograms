#syntax --> format of writing a statement.





#2. While loop --> executes a group of statements repeatedly as long as the condition is true.
                #syntax -   
                          #  while condition:           ---> header
                          #      statements             ---> Body
                          


#3. For loop --> repeatedly executes a group of statement depending on a sequence.
                #sequence --> group of elements. ex. str, list, tuple, bytes, range.

                #syntax: 
                          #  for var in sequence:       ---> header
                          #      statements             ---> Body


#4. pass stmt --> statement that will not do anything.
        #use when we do not want to give any statement.



#5. break stmt --> will break loop and come out of it.
                # 



#6. continue --> to continue the loop from begining.
                #sub sequence statements in the loop are not executed.





#7. assert stmt --> assert means validate.
                    #for validating the user input. if the cond fails then it will raise AssertionError.
                    #assertion --> run time error.
                    #Assertionerror.
                    #if cond is true --> it will execute next statements.





#try --> its a block



#else suit --> can use the else outside the loop. 

#in operaor -->
#not in operator --> 


#8. return stmt
